**Approach**

 store data into an array from the form.

 1. a get request that takes an id parameter and it displays a form.  
 2. a post method that stores the data in an array.  
 3. display a link after the post method is executed.

 
**Improvements** 

 - use a DB perhaps MongoDB  
 - functions can be broken down to more methods for better readability and reusability

**To run the app**

run "npm install"
run "npm start"

Go to your browser and type 

localhost:3000
